imgur-automator
======

Install the folder action on automator, open the shell script and paste your api key over "YOUR_KEY".
You really would not want to keep the action to the desktop, so read this http://osxdaily.com/2011/01/26/change-the-screenshot-save-file-location-in-mac-os-x/

You can get your api key here: https://imgur.com/register/api_anon
You can also request a api key for your gallery, just look it up (you have to use OAuth for that).

Enjoy! :)

Dependencies
======

You'll need pycurl (acctually, I'm planning to rewrite this without pycurl)
