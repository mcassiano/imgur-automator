imgur-automator
======

Install the folder action on automator, open the shell script and paste your api key over "YOUR_KEY".
You really would not want to keep the action to the desktop, so read this http://osxdaily.com/2011/01/26/change-the-screenshot-save-file-location-in-mac-os-x/

Dependencies
======

You'll need pycurl (acctually, I'm planning to rewrite this without pycurl)
